# Optimal-Gas-Pipeline-using-Prim's-Algorithm

1) We create a simple example gas pipeline network graph with five nodes and assign random weights to the edges.

2) We use NetworkX's built-in function to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph, which is essentially Prim's algorithm. This tree represents the optimized gas pipeline network.

3) We visualize both the original gas pipeline network and the optimized network (minimum spanning tree) side by side for comparison.

4)This code demonstrates how to use Prim's algorithm to optimize a gas pipeline network by finding the minimum spanning tree.
It then visualizes both the original and optimized networks to understand the optimization visually.
